Yes, shock horror, Marc is annoyed at Google! The one night in the past month or two I've had the motivation to update my project site and my blog, what does Google Do? It decides to give me 502 server errors from AdSense, Configuration errors from Friend Connect, and to top it all off, my Android Phone restarted itself and wiped my inbox.</p>
<p>Not really a good day for Google, is it? I'm sure I can let it slide this once, but I'm not too happy about being up until 3:30am fixing a layout which should have been done hours ago.</p>
<p>Anyways, rant over. I will get my revenge.</p>
