Well, looks like something new to bring me back here, which seems like something useful, and i would actually use rather than the Blogger Designer they released a few weeks ago. Yesterday, <a href="http://bloggerindraft.blogspot.com/2010/07/introducing-blogger-stats.html">Google released Real-Time analytics for Blogger</a>. This now means we can track out stats on out blogs easily from within the Blogger dashboard, rather than having to log into Google Analytics separately.</p>
<p>Now, I haven't exactly been updating this thing lately, but now I feel like I have to just so I can watch the real-time graph go up and up! My only question is; why doesn't Google Analytics have this feature? Wouldn't it have made more sense to give Analytics users this kind of power, then better integrate Blogger with that? Well, I'm sure Google has it's reasons, I'm just curious to find out what they are.</p>
