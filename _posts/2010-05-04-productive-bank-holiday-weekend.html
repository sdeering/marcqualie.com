Well, the 3 day weekend was nice while it lasted. Sadly back to work tomorrow, however I made great use of the extra day! Normally I don't do anything productive, so this came as a surprise to me as well as you guys, trust me!</p>
<p>Remember good old Squiggle that I started making a while back? Well it's been redesigned and pumped with steroids. In order to motivate myself to work (cause let's face it, I'm lazy!), I decided to invest some money into the project and make it as a standalone site. So I bought a domain, some hosting, and will buy some advertising when it's finished.</p>
<p>Obviously this project is going to take a long time to get it where I want it to go. For example, I would love to have a layer system and basic photo editing from within an online website, which would also have a mini desktop version and some sort of storage for users. A feature to share your creations with your friends via Facebook Open Graph, and also saving entire projects including undo/redo history similar to a full-featured desktop app. Most of these features I've actually managed to do, but they need improving and tidying up, then making look pretty.</p>
<p>If you want to follow progress on the Squiggle project you can either <a href="http://twitter.com/squigglecanvas">follow it on twitter</a> or keep checking back on <a href="http://www.squigglecanvas.com/">squigglecanvas.com</a>. You can also follow or subscribe to this blog, and look for the label Squiggle. Hope you guys enjoy the features I'm going to add.</p>
