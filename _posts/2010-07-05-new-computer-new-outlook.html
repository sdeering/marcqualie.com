I finally got my Computer after months of being indecisive (and skint)! It was definitely worth the wait though. So  I've decided I should really get all my projects up to scratch since I have a super fast development machine. I spent the last week or so downloading programs and files so I can get back into my work, but I failed to realise 4+ years worth of work packs quite a bit of storage space and configuration. I still haven't even got a fully working local server, which sucks!</p>
<p>Anyway, back on track! I am going to start by redesigning my personal site, <a href="http://www.marcqualie.com/">www.marcqualie.com</a>, because basically, It's not doing what I built it to do. I intentionally made the site for a personal portfolio of work, which I never seem to do. I have built a new engine for the site including amazing admin features I use in some of my freelance work, so I'm hoping to update it a lot more, and put some cool new stuff on there for you guys to check out!</p>
<p>Secondly, I will finish <a href="http://www.squigglecanvas.com/">Squiggle Canvas</a>. This project is a personal favourite, but I just simply never get enough to sit down and work on it as the script is so complex and takes hours of building and debugging. Help if you wish? I am planning to make a Plug-in API for you JavaScript developers to have some cool playtime with it, then if that takes off I shall open-source the project and release it fully.</p>
<p>But for now I need layout/design Ideas for my site. Any ideas, suggestions or hate mail will be apreciated, replied to, and if appropriate, accompanied with a Ninja!</p>
