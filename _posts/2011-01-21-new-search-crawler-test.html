This is just a quick post to test the speed and accuracy of my new Crawler. I rewrote the search engine for <a href="http://marcqualie.com/">marcqualie.com</a> entirely, creating a multi-threaded environment to separate the crawler and the indexer. From now on pages will be indexable and searchable within seconds of the crawler detecting that page, if that page has passed indexing checks. There is also a new instant search feature which is lightening fast, and extremely accurate. I will only be letting my friends test this feature out for now for stability reasons, then I will release it to everyone. Instant search supports open graph parsing and rich media such as flash and images. There is also a secret project coming soon, which incorporates a lot of this technology I'm experimenting with right now. Also, if you're wondering why this is a test post; it's so I can see how long it takes my site to auto crawl and index the content after I click publish.</p>
