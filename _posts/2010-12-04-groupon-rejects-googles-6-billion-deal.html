It has just been confirmed that Groupon, the group buying website, has turned down a rather staggering $6 Billion deal from Google. Groupon's current annual income is rumored at around $2 Billion, which could be the reason this offer was turned down. At it's current rate of growth, in about 2 years time Google's offer would have been a sell out. Groupon is currently one of the world's fastest growing company's, and shows true potential, however as a customer for about 5 months, I've never actually purchased anything due to the lack of quality deals. This could mainly be due to the city I live in, but only time will tell.</p>
