I'm pretty new to Blender, and hadn't really heard of <a href="http://www.blendswap.com/" target="_blank">BlendSwap</a> until today. It's basically a repository where users can submit their Blender creations to share with the community and download creations that people have already made. I'm really enjoying Blender, it's easy to pick up and very advanced. I'm currently working on some Flash/Java projects which include 3d assets, but more on those as I make more progress. If you're a fan of Blender you should check out the updated BlendSwap.</p>
