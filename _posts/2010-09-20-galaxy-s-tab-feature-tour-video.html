<p>This is the feature tour for the new <a href="http://blog.marcqualie.com/2010/09/samsung-galaxy-s-tab-is-official.html">Galaxy S Tab I wrote about</a> a few weeks ago. Looks impressive, right? Well sure, but do they really expect us to be putting a £600 device in our back pockets in plain view? I think not. Personally I'd carry my bag around with me at all times just to keep this thing nice and safe. The only thing I don't like is the fact it is so expensive. Prices have been rumoured between £600 &#8211; £800 for a wifi version, and a bit more for the 3G enabled version. If I had to choose between this and a phone, I would probably go for the phone, unless Santa wants to be very kind, or my readers would like to donate me lots of moneys? I can dream, right? Anyways, back to the point. This is a very impressive device, and as you know I love Android, so I can't wait until it's funally released in the UK. Watch the video and see what you think.</p>
