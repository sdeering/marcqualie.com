It's 3am so i'm lying in bed posting from my phone, how awesome! Anyways I thought I would share what's on my mind.</p>
<p>
<p>Who would have thought me of all people wouldn't use certain Google products? Well it turns out I totally overlooked some cool stuff, which could make my life a lot easier. Would be even easier if these services were android based, but one step at a time, yeah? Check out Google Notebook, Bookmarks and Reader if you get the chance. I will be doing a full product sweep and review tomorrow when I get some time.</p>
<p>
<p>Squiggle Canvas is taking off quite nicely, getting on average of 20 unique visitors per day! I can't wait to add the new version, which I created from all your feedback!it includes features like Facebook photo album integration, and image cloning! Also faster loading and running times, but more on that later!</p>
<p>
<p>Facebook is getting ready to launch a new feature, which should be interesting. I am going to apply for beta access, but you have to submit 3 custom articles, which have to be written professionally and accurately. Oh the joy, so wish me luck!</p>
<p>
<p>Finally, my blog needs a complete overhaul, don't you think? Blogger just launched their new template designer, which I guess is okay for noobs but I found it unsatisfying. I want to design something unique and custom, but to be honest, I'm useless. Ideas?</p>
<p>
<p>I will update this post with links to sites and articles when I get to a computer, so if they aren't there check back in a few hours!</p>
