Below is an article from MSDN, where a Microsoft employee openly mocks <a href="http://blog.marcqualie.com/2011/01/google-is-to-drop-support-for-h264.html"> Google's decision to no longer support H.264 video</a> which I wrote about earlier this week. I found it quite amusing, so thought I would share.
<div style="margin-top: 12px;">The world’s ability to communicate with one another is a key factor in its rapid evolution and economic growth. The <a href="http://www.webmproject.org/" style="color: #ca491d; font-weight: normal; outline-color: initial; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; text-decoration: none;">Esperanto language </a>was invented last century as a politically neutral language that would foster peace and international understanding. Since the launch, we’ve seen first-hand the benefits of a constructed language:</div>
<ul>
<li>A pure form of communication that is unsullied by cultural context;</li>
<li>Broad adoption by as many as 10,000 speakers</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperantido" style="color: #ca491d; font-weight: normal; outline-color: initial; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; text-decoration: none;">Independent</a> (yet mostly compatible) dialects that not only bring additional choice for speakers also foster healthy competition and innovation</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-top: 12px;">We expect even more communication between people in the coming year and are therefore focusing our investments in languages that are created based on constructed language principles. To that end, <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2011/01/html-video-codec-support-in-chrome.html" style="color: #ca491d; font-weight: normal; outline-color: initial; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; text-decoration: none;">we are changing the spoken and written language of this nation</a> to make it consistent with the form of speech already supported by the <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/" style="color: #ca491d; font-weight: normal; outline-color: initial; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; text-decoration: none;">Language Creation Society</a>. Specifically, we are supporting the<a href="http://www.webmproject.org/" style="color: #ca491d; font-weight: normal; outline-color: initial; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; text-decoration: none;">Esperanto</a> and <a href="http://theora.org/" style="color: #ca491d; font-weight: normal; outline-color: initial; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; text-decoration: none;">Klingon</a> languages, and will consider adding support for other high-quality constructed languages in the future. Though <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264" style="color: #ca491d; font-weight: normal; outline-color: initial; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; text-decoration: none;">English</a> plays an important role in speech today, as our goal is to enable open innovation, its further use as a form of communication in this country will be prohibited and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/" style="color: #ca491d; font-weight: normal; outline-color: initial; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; text-decoration: none;">our resources</a> directed towards languages that are untainted by real-world usage.</div>
<div style="margin-top: 12px;">These changes will occur in the next couple months but we are announcing them now to give citizens using other languages an opportunity to translate the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/01/h-264-66-percent-web-video/" style="color: #ca491d; font-weight: normal; outline-color: initial; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; text-decoration: none;">libraries of the world</a> into Esperanto.</div>
<div style="margin-top: 12px;"><em>Dankon, nedankinde!</em></div>
