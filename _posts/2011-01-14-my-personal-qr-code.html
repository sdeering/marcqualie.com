I got bored and decided to change my profile photo on my social networks to a QR code pointing to my website. I've been interested in them for a while, but never been able to find any solid documentation on how to create them. Fortunately I found an <a href="http://phpqrcode.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">open source library</a> to do it for me! Now I have my very own QR code that you can scan with your mobiles. Not only that, but it looks sort of cool aswel!</p>
