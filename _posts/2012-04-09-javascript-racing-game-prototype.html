<p>I've just finished working on the first prototype for my up and coming racing engine written in Javascript. It's nowhere near finished, but it gets the simple concept across of where this could be taken. Right now it's not a game at all, it's simply an engine which can be used to make a game. I wrote a basic one track map, with dumb AI cars and a player controlled car to show some of the functionality. Please excuse the bad graphics, I will be improving them later as the project develops. </p>

<p>I will upload the code to Github as a fully open source project once the project reaches a mature stage. Right now it's pretty messy since it only took me one day to write. This is also a chance to show off a new kind of Framework I have been thinking about, where Javascript games can take over and become as popular as Flash games by getting rid of the one thing holding them back, but I will write more about that in another post once that project has been launched. I've embdeded the game below for you to play around with.</p>

<p>Make sure you press the spawn car button to view the simple AI I started to write for it. I may draw up a simple gravel track so it looks a bit nicer later on tonight if I get time, but right now I'm focusing on the code only. Let me know what you think in the comments?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> The code is now live over at <a href="https://github.com/MarcQualie/racing.js" target="_blank">https://github.com/marcqualie/racing.js</a> and the demo above is actually hosted from that repo on Github Pages</p>
