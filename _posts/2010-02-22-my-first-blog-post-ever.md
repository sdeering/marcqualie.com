So I finally decided to start blogging, yay for me! Took me long enough. I got annoyed at myself for putting everything off, always saying I'll do it tomorrow. Unfortunately, tomorrow never happens. I thought maybe if I write my plans down and a few random stalkers from the Internet read it then it would motivate me to actually finish what I started. Good theory, let's put it to the test.

I'm hoping to display all of this on my [personal website](http://marcqualie.com), however that would mean learning Google Data API (as if don't have enough to juggle around already!), so for now it's going to be all hosted on Blogger.com, which is most likely where you will be reading this post.

I've managed to rant on throughout a whole paragraph and haven't even got the point of this Blog yet; If you're still reading, well done to you! This blog will be about my current development projects, including cool JavaScript, Flash and PHP things. I will upload them onto this site as I finish them so feel free to try them out and download the source code as all of my projects will be open sourced over on [github.com/marcqualie](https://github.com/marcqualie).

If you're still reading then you're either a Geek, don't have a clue what any of the above means and have nothing better to do. There's also the option that I paid you to read it in which case I changed my mind and want my money back!
