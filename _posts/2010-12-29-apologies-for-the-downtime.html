Since the 22nd of December, my Blog has been unavailable to anyone. The problem was caused when I transferred my domain to a new registrar and the DNS Settings weren't copied correctly. Normally I would have noticed an issue like this straight away, but since it was Christmas I wasn't on-line much to keep an eye on things. The sub domain has been rerouted to the correct server and my Blog is now fully accessible to everyone.</p>
