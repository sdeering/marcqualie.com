Nearly every network is offering it on price plans which beat Blackberry and even the iPhone 4. You can get the phone free on most networks for £35+, which is rather annoying considering I just got a 2 years contract on the HTC Wildfire, oops. Not to worry though, as it will be sold as sim-only from many sites such as Play.com and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/HTC-A8181-Quad-Band-GPS-International-Brown/dp/B0038JDF3E?ie=UTF8&tag=marcsblo-20&link_code=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969" target="_blank">Amazon</a> (pictured left). The original retail price was going to be £500+ however due to the huge demand and competition between stores, the price keeps dropping, with Amazon now selling for £470. Personally, I believe paying that much for a phone is a bit ridiculous, so I'm still looking forward to the Galaxy S Tab which I am going to write about in my next post. <img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=marcsblo-20&l=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969&o=1&a=B0038JDF3E" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important;" width="1" />Other options of course include the HTC Desire Z, which is very similar to the G2 which was released in America. It has a full Qwerty keyboard, and looks amazing, however, the only thing putting me off this device is the 800mz processor, which when compared to nearly all other phones these days is a bit behind in terms of performance. On the other hand, it's also quite a bit cheaper then the Desire HD.</p>
