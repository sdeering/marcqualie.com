<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/550/" target="_blank">Left 4 Dead 2</a> is one of my favourite games, probably always will be. There's nothing like dropping into a random game and shooting the hell out of hordes of zombies while drinking and munching snacks. If you don't already own this, you're seriously missing out. Only £3.75 for the next 24 hours. If anyone is up for a game, add me on Steam and let's party!</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> Left 4 Dead 2 is no longer on sale, however you can still <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/550/">purchase it at a great price</a>.</p>
