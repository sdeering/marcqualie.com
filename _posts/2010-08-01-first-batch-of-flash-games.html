You may have noticed I now have games on my site. These games are powered by FogDev, a sub-division of the company I work for, <a href="http://www.freeonlinegames.com/?utm_source=marcqualie.com">Free Online Games</a>. I made this section to experiment with usability, search engine visibility and use interaction with games and surrounding content. Right now the games section is very basic, but I am hoping to change that over the next week or so. If you would like me to add certain games please don't hesitate to contact me via the new contact page I have also added to the top of the site.</p>
