Quick post to let you know that my Search engine can now support more than one word per search, and will order results depending on the order of the words, and the relevance in both the title and the description. My engine is open to any website which wishes to participate, with a limit of 500 links for testing and load balancing. Also, the engine updates itself every 30 minutes, so new content is found fast and with no user input required. Please contact me if you wish to have your site appear in the results, and test out the engine at <a href="http://www.marcqualie.com/">http://www.marcqualie.com/</a></p>
