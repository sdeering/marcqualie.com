Aardvark have just decided to post theirselves on Facebook and Twitter. I've used this service for a few months now and answered a lot of questions. I reccomend you join, especially if you're a programmer, as there is an active community of guys out there to help you with your problems. If you choose to answer questions, then you do get your fair share of idiots who could have clearly just googled their question as it was so generic, or should fold into a featel position and hope god goes easy on them. Overall it's a great service, so check it out at <a href="http://vark.com/">vark.com</a>Â and add me.</p>
