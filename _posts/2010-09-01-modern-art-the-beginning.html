So, today I decided it would be a good idea to start drawing again. There was a spare tablet at work, and it could help my new project, so I grabbed it and started drawing. To be honest, it's a mess. I cannot draw for s**t, basically. After about 30 minutes I came up with the picture on the left. A lot more practice is needed, agreed? I'm gonna buy a tablet at home, maybe, when I win the lottery (these things are stupidly expensive!), or maybe I'll get a nice android tablet and do my drawings on there? Either way, I need to improve. If you have any drawing tips, contact me, I might be nice in return.</p>
