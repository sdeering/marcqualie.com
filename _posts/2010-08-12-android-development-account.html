Hey guys, this is my 50th Blog post, didn't realise I'd end up getting this far but I think well done to me for not getting bored! This post is about the fact I've just signed up for an Android Development and Publisher account, which means I can now start building apps for the market and making my millions within 24 hours? Okay, maybe not millions but you have to start somewhere, right? Now all I need to do is wait for my new phone which I should have in less than 2 weeks! My next few phones will be reviewing various Android phones available in the UK, just in case you're interested in buying one. Follow my Blog if you want to stay up to date.</p>
