Today, I saw a lovely clock whilst browsing ThinkGeek. It was a very simple interface, with gorgeous LED lights. So simple in fact, it didn't display any numbers. The time output was displayed as Binary format using the LED lights to represent each bit. I loved this idea so much, I wanted one. However, as they cost about £35 I decided to go about making my own (I'm a Developer after all, right?). Unfortunately, I don't have the skills to build the hardware (although I have been looking into it), so it was a software solution. I quickly created this simple Javascript LED clock which runs in any browser, to help learn to read binary fast. I will create a desktop version and eventually replace my standard clock in Windows. Let me know what you think on my contact page?</p>
