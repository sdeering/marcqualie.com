This is possibly one of the funniest sets of video's I've seen in a while. You all remember the Mac vs. PC ads, right? Of course you do, they were hugely funny and catchy. However, what you may not know is that the framework Ruby On Rails has a similar set of videos to make sly digs at other languages where they fail to compete. Personally, I have never used Ruby, but this is soon to change as after watching these videos I'm very intrigued to see what the capabilities of this open-source language are. I don't have time to embed all 9 videos but I have embedded my favourite one below, I would really recommend watching them all! Even though these videos are almost 3 years old, it'll be interesting to see how the languages and frameworks are doing these days.</p>
