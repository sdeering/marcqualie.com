Today I was sent a Beta invite to the new search service Blekko. I have only just received this invite and began to test their features, so this is basically just an overview informing of you of features. A detailed post will follow at later date.  <br/><br/>At first glance, Blekko seems very basic. Is this a good thing? I think so, yes. It gives you the power, and functionality you would expect from a search engine, with the added bonus of features such as slashtags (will explain later), statistics and the fact everything is linked into your profile for easy sharing. All of this is combined into a very simple streamlined results page, with links to the content you want, delivering only the basics you need to skim read the results fast.  <br/><br/>Slashtags? You may be wondering what these weirdly named creatures are. As far as I can tell, they are basically fast ways of customizing your search terms, which can be personalized, grouped, and even shared to your friends, so you can get better, and more relevant results to you. Below is the official description from the Blekko website.  <br/><br/><span style="color: #999999;"><i>&#8220;</i></span><span style="color: #292929; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"><i>slashtags search only the sites you want and cut out the spam sites. use friends, experts, community or your own slashtags to slash in what you want and slash out what you don't.&#8221; - </i><span style="color: black;"><b>Blekko</b></span></span> <br/><br/><span style="color: #292929; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="color: black;">Another great feature I have noticed is SEO statistics. You may notice that the search results given by Blekko, are somewhat different from results given by Google and other search engines. Unlike other search engines, Blekko will tell you why a search result is placed where it is. Giving you advanced info on inbound, outbound and even the anchor tags used on links. This can be very helpful to webmasters such as myself to help optimize our web pages for search engines, without compromising on usability. I'd also like to note, very similar information is available via Google Webmaster Tools, however I have not explored Blekko SEO Stats well enough to make a detailed comparison.</span></span> <br/><br/><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">I do believe Blekko is in Beta right now, and may require an invite to join and search. If you are interested in joining this Beta, I am sure you can contact them via the <a href="http://twitter.com/blekko" target="_blank">Blekko Twitter Page</a>.</span></span></p>
