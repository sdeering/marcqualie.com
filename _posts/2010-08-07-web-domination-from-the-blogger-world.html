It's 3:30am and I'm very bored. I decided I need to write on this more, with useful stuff, and I need people to read it, right? So I've just joined god knows how many random social Blogging sites, and tried to set them up using random linking systems such as <a href="http://blog.marcqualie.com/2010/05/twitterfeed-review.html">Twitterfeed</a> and Ping.fm. Between these two sites I'm hoping they will psend this Blog post to over 10 different social sites I just Joined including Delicious, Posterous and StatusNet. Another reason for doing this at 3am is if things go terribly wrong, many of my accounts are going to get well and truly spammed.. let's hope not, eh?</p>
