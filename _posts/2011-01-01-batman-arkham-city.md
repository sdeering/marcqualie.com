I have recently just discovered the [12 Games of Christmas](http://www.gameon.co.uk/game/news/2010/the-12-games-of-christmas-2010) from GameOn. Above is a first look at Batman: Arkham City, which in my opinion is going to be epic. Not only do the graphics look insanely realistic and powerful, but the storyline seems very very promising. I'll let you guys check out the video while I go and have another shot at Arkham Asylum. Oh, fun times.
