<p>Above is a video of Andy Rubin showing off the Motorola Prototype which is loaded with the unreleased Android 3.0 (Honeycomb). If you're excited about the Android 2.3 (Gingerbread), which was released this week, then you're going to love this demo. He accidentally teases us with some integrated video chat application, so the system looks promising. Through-out the video the hosts pull up comparisons to the iPad. I think the iPad is way over-rated and something needs to come along to take it down a peg or two. Unfortunately the Samsung Galaxy Tab didn't succeed in doing this, so maybe Google and Motorola have a better shot?</p>
