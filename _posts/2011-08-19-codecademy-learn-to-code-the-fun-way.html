This morning, I just stumbled across a cool site which teaches people who to code, without it being an entirely tedious task. The site tries to engage people by actually letting them code in a console window while they are learning, getting feedback as they progress through the stages. The site is <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">http://www.codecademy.com/</a> and I advise you try it out if you're wanting to get into basic coding, or you just want to play around with an interactive console window for a while.</p>
