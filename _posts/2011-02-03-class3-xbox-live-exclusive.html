Undead labs have just released information regarding their upcoming title &#8220;Class3&#8243;. They have entered a publishing deal with Microsoft Game Studios to develop this new online, ever changing zombie survival horror game. Undead Labs will use Class3 as a platform to develop its other unannounced project, Class4, a persistent online game, (not an MMO) and will released at a later date.</p>
