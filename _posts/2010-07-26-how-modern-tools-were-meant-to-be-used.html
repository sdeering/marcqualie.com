It's so true. How often is modern technology used for anything constructive or educational? In fact, almost everyone I know who uses the internet and watches TV all of the time are complete and utter morons who wouldn't know the difference between radio wave and a tidal wave.</p>
<p>There is also another great example of this that an artist created using Microsoft's new Kinect system as the target. You can check it outÂ <a href="http://www.vgcats.com/comics/?strip_id=294" target="_blank">here</a>. This demonstrates how things are very rarely used the way they are intended.</p>
<p>Welcome to the modern world, I guess. But on the other hand, without these tools, where would we get our entertainment? I vote strip clubs!</p>
