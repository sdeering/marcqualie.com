<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">Since you are most likely reading this Blog via some sort of Twitterfeed link without realising, I thought it was a good idea to write a review on the service, as I'm quite happy with it.</span></span>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 13px;"><br /></span></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">Previously I posted my Blog posts to Facebook and Twitter via either manually posting the links to Twitter, or using Facebook's inbuilt feed reader. Both of these have downfalls, and aren't very efficient at all. To start with, having to post links to Twitter manually is just time consuming, and annoying really. Why should I have have to do this, especially since I normally need to shorten the links first!</span></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 13px;"><br /></span></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">Then we get to Facebook's inbuilt feed reader, which in all honesty, is a bit of a scam. Not only does it not actually link back to the post on the original Blog, but it also imports it to Facebook's note system, and gives no reference to where the post came from. Personally, I can't see any advantage to this, and Facebook actually annoyed me by doing this. First of all I can't track how many people are reading my posts, and have no control over it. Secondly, it doesn't send any traffic to my Blog, or give me and any credit for it, which is quite mean really.</span></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 13px;"><br /></span></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">So then I found Twitterfeed. It was nice and easy to sign up and link all my accounts, no passwords needed and a completely seamless user interface, which is what I've come to expect from web applications these days. Now I don't have to do anything, I can just write my posts, then sit back and Twitterfeed does the rest! It will post links to Twitter, Facebook and other services I specify without being prompted, and even give me real-time stats to track how well each post is doing.</span></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 13px;"><br /></span></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">Instantly i went from being annoyed about sharing my posts to my Facebook wall and Twitter feed, but now it's all done for me so I can relax, and not worry about Facebook hi-jacking my posts any more. So I will try to write more posts, more frequently in the future.</span></span></div>
