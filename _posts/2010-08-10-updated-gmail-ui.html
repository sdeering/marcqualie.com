Google have <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/updates-to-contacts-and-slightly-new.html">just announced</a> many new updates and improvements to Google Mail. The new features look very promising, I have always been annoyed by the contact interface, mainly because I use it to update my Android contacts when I need to do big changes such as adding thumbnails, addresses and email addresses. They have even decreased the header size by a tiny 16px, which may not seem like a lot, but when you put into perspective that people using netbooks and tablets don't always have the luxury of plentyful screen estate, this is quite a lot less scrolling to see more messages. I am always working on ways to improve UI on projects, and nearly always use Google as a role model in this area. Unfortunately I haven't got the updates yet, even though they are meant to be rolled out today. I will update this post as soon as I get the updates and review them. Let me know if you have the updates and what you think of them?</p>
