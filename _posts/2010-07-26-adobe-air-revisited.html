Hey guys, I found an interesting post on Adobe AIR earlier today and decided I should go back into development for that platform. A while back I created a powerful Desktop Application which was basically a management system for a company, with synced address books, schedules, documents and messaging with outside clients. From that description you can get the general idea that I used a wide variety of the features that AIR offers. However, this was a very long time ago, and since then I am guessing I have forgotten most of the tools used to develop such an application.</p>
<p>But now I have the best reason ever to learn this again. I want to make Squiggle Canvas a desktop based application. The main problem I had with this project (and the reason I stopped developing for a while) is due to the fact it was too inconsistent. I wanted to create a fast, lightweight image creator/editor in the browser, using HTML5.. which I did! However only some browsers support these HTML5 capabilities, and the ones that do render the canvas tools differently due to the fact the Canvas Tag is still is early stages of implementation into standards.</p>
<p>So here I am with a problem, either scrap the project entirely or find a way around this to make it consistent. The answer I came up with is AIR! It makes perfect sense! Not only does AIR use the WebKit Engine, which is the main client I designed Squiggle Canvas for, but it also allows me to use the full capabilities of the OS to create a truly powerful imaging tool; whilst staying within the HTML5 platform. I will still offer a very basic lightweight version for creation fast, yet fun Squiggles. But for people who really want to do some amazing artwork, and take advantage of the new features I have install, such as competitions and exporting etc, this will be amazing and revolutionary.</p>
<p>The main technical limitations I had while developing Squiggle was image size, and browser memory. Once people started creating large, complex and visually stunning Squiggles, I noticed a lack in performance on the browser size. There is no way of managing memory such as the native OS offers. Also image size was a huge issue! Syncing the large images as the client was editing was a heavy load on the server, but was also necessary due to the frequency of crashes, causing the user to loose data if the information was not backed up. This was all done seamlessly in the backtground, so the user got the smoothest performance, but it was killing my server (poor thing!).</p>
<p>There you have it. My great new idea to port the main Squiggle Canvas App over to Desktop (Windows, Mac and Linux compatible!!), and keep a basic tool on-line for users who don't wish to download the client. Keep checking back for updates, as I will be wanting BETA testers in the early stages from all platforms, especially Mac and Linux, as I don't have these, YET! But that's another Blog post entirely..</p>
