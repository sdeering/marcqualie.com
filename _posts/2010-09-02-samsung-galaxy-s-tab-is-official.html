<p>Yes, it's finally here! I wrote a week or so ago about this amazing device, and now that's it's finally been declaredÂ officially, and ready for release i'm so excited. I've held off so far on buying the HTC Desire (mainly due to lack of stock, damn T-mobile), however I am now considering waiting till the Tab is released. Not only are the specs about the same, but I can keep the tab on my desk and use it more usefully than a phone. Also, due to the fact it runs Android 2.2 (Froyo) and large 1024×600 resolution, it will be an amazing device to develop on.</p>
<p>It has a 1ghz cortex processor, 2 3MP cameras with flash and comes in either 16gb or 32gb varieties with a further 32gb capcity via SD card. It looks very promising, so I'm hoping to get my hands on one very soon!</p>
