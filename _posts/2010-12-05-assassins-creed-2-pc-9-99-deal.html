<p>Renaissance Italy isn't the usual sort of setting for a video game, but then Assassin's Creed isn't one to play by the rules. Ezio Auditore di Firenze is yet another ancestor of modern day Desmond Miles &#8211; a nobleman out to avenge the death of his family in the guise of a shadowy assassin.</p>
<p>Like the last game you're given total freedom to explore multiple cities, but with greatly improved parkour skills and the new ability to swim. There's also a lot more variety in the missions you undertake &#8211; the main complaint with the original game- so you'll never feel you're just doing the same tasks over and over again.</p>
<p>Combat has also been completely overhauled, with dozens of different weapons and a new health system. With no less than Leonardo da Vinci acting as your very own Q style gadget master this stunning sequel improves on every element of the original.</p>
