This is my 200th post but also my first on my new WordPress system. Previously I was using Blogger, then a mixture of that and my own built system which I never had time to maintain, but updates were time-consuming and annoying so here we are on WordPress 3.4. Now that I have a stable platform to write from I will be writing a lot more frequently about loads of interesting topics including MongoDB, CouchBase and some of my new projects I've been building over the months such as Hoard. Let me know what you think in the comments and what kind of topics you guys would like to see?</p>
