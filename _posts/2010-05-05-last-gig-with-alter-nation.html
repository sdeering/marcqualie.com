Well the night has come to play my last gig with Alter-Nation. Over the past year or so I’ve had fun playing with the band, but I’ve finally decided it’s time to leave. Not only have I decided to quit the band, but I’ve decided to stop playing drums all together and go back to the days of Piano and Guitar. I really miss playing real music, and using my talents so it’s time for a change I think.</p>
<p>The band line up has changed quite a lot while I’ve been with the band, with it now having a steady setup consisting of 2 great guitarists, enthusiastic bassist and singer, and once upon a time, MarcoBoomTing as the drummer. They have a strong setup and should put on some good gigs in the future.</p>
<p>Since joining the band we came together really well and we’ve played some amazing gigs, including a few pandemics and various bars around Sunderland Town, with everything finally coming together for one last gig in Savannah tonight. I’m hoping this gig will complement all the time and effort we’ve put into our cover set, but unfortunately I doubt we’ll get to play any of our originals tonight, which is a shame. So if you’re in the Sunderland area drop in and come watch us perform between 7pm and 11pm, it’s totally free and there are a few guests playing with us.</p>
<p>The band has great potential and I with them all the best in their progress towards the top.</p>
