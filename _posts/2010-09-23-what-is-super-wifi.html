<p>Well, Super WiFi, is in fact, standard WiFi. It will still give you the same data, and be accessed the same way, but on a different frequency. Basically since TV has gone digital, there is now so called “white-space” which is the space between the signal for your TV channels. As far as I can gather from various posts around the net, this WiFi 2.0 will operate from 500mhz – 700mhz rather than the standard 2.4ghz – 5ghz. Even though everyone seems excited about this right now, don't expect it anytime soon. However, when it does land, the possibilities for mobile networking will be vastly increased.</p>
