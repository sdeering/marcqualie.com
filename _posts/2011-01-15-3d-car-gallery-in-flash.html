I've been designing a 3D Flash Gallery that can render .3ds models fully in Flash. The models aren't mine, they belong to a friend, who I will credit when he finally gets his site finished! I'm building the demo to showcase his models, and also showcase the 3D capabilities of Flash. These models are extremely detailed as they are designed for pc games, so I'm having quite a bit of trouble getting flash to perform well when animation them. Some of the models between 30,000 &#8211; 60,000 polygons per frame which is almost one million polygons per second. Not much these days for graphics cards running pc games, but on 32 bit single threaded virtual sandbox like Flash, it's a whole different world.</p>
