<p>I've decided that having my Blog hosted on 3rd party software is no longer an option. After 3+ years of posting originally on Blogger, then on Wordpress I've decided to finally integrate it into my main site, which I rebuilt from the ground up a few days ago.</p>

<p>There will most likely be a few teething problems after the switch as there are a lot of things I haven't fully finished writing yet such as the feed system and pagination. For now, there is simple search at the top which will also be replaced in coming days. Right now I'm just happy to be not using Wordpress anymore as it was awful to update, horrible coding, not very modular and so, so slow hogging a lot of my server resources.</p>

<p>Now that I finally have the foundation for my own custom blogging platform I can start writing a lot more frequently as I have a huge backlog of cool projects that I want to share with you guys. I'm also going to start doing request posts and reviews on new applications, software and tech so suggestions are welcome!</p>
