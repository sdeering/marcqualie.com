Good question, why DO I work so late? Honestly, I have no idea, I just seem to always get more motivated when there are less distractions, less light, and less common sense. As far as I can understand, my consciousness turns off andÂ weird/crazy ideas start popping into my head, sorts of things that I would never think of while awake (or sane for that matter). If you haven't already tried it, try staying up till about 2 or 3am then starting a random project, something you've wanted to do for a while but either thought was impossible, or too crazy to ever work out. I've been doing this a lot lately, and there are loads of almost finished projects going up on my site in the next few weeks! My next project is going to be OpenID authentication for my site (I have my reasons, be patient), then a website analyser and optimiser which will tie in with and upgraded version of my <a href="http://www.marcqualie.com/projects/css-compressor/">CSS Compression API</a>! There's also a fun racing game for you none Tech Savvy followers. Keep checking back for updates, or subscribe to my <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/marcqualie">RSS Feed</a>.</p>
