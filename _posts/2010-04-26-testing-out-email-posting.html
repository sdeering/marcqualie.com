So I just found this new feature in the blogger dashboard, and I hope it works as I don't really feel like writing all of this out again!</p>
<p>Basically I'm bored lying in bed at 4am, just finished a prototype for a new product I'm working on, the Squiggle board. It will get it's own blog, maybe even a few, in the future but thought I may aswel talk about it since that's the reason I'm awake, and my brain is to tired to think about much else right now!</p>
<p>The Squiggle board is going to be a HTML5 plugin that can run inside websites and either act as a client side time waster tool; cause we all like those little toys, an online gallery where you can share your creations with others, and even a completly live collaboration artwork software whichs syncs up clients drawings in realtime. Pretty sweet huh?</p>
<p>I already have the components ready separate, it's just a case of putting them all into this project and optimizing it for production. I will be asking for early testers, so if you're interested contact me!</p>
