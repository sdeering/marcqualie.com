Well, April Fools day is pretty much over and I've decided to put together a list of my favourite highlights of the day in case any of you missed them. If I've missed any that you found particularly interesting, just comment and I might just add it to the list.<br /><a name='more'></a><b><br /></b><br /><b>Google is hiring more Auto Completers</b><br />By now I'm sure you've noticed Google's handy auto complete feature, and wondered how it works so fast. Many of you may think it's a mixture of high powered servers, complex algorithms and some very late nights for some programming geniuses. Wrong. In fact, it's powered by ordinary people who just happen to be able to type very fast.. and read people's minds! Yes, Google auto complete is powered by psychic humans! <a href="http://blog.marcqualie.com/2011/04/life-as-google-auto-completer.html">Check out the video</a> on how all of this is done! You didn't think it was automated, did you?</p>
<p><b>Gmail Motion</b><br />Oh how I wish this product was a reality. Gmail motion means you never have to use your keyboard or mouse again while using email! It's sort of like Kinect for everyday tasks, who wouldn't want that? The best part is it will work with any standard camera! Full details over at the <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2011/04/introducing-gmail-motion.html" target="_blank">Official Gmail Blog</a>.</p>
<p><b>Google Chromercise</b><br />My fingers are tired just from typing this post, never mind using Chrome all day! Thank god for <a href="http://blog.marcqualie.com/2011/04/everybody-chromercise.html">Chromercise</a>! Now I can do my daily workout without every leaving my desk. The best part is the outfits you get to wear while breaking out a hand sweat!</p>
<p><b>Helvetica</b><br />A random but fun addition from Google is when you type Helvetica into Google, something interesting happens! Go try it out over at <a href="http://google.com/" target="_blank">google.com</a>?</p>
<p><b>Google is switching to Comic Sans</b><br />Yay! My dream has come true, now all <a href="http://www.google.com/landing/csfe/" target="_blank">Google services will be using Comic Sans</a> as their default font. Why haven't they this already? Also, I like the idea of Google AdSense in Windings format. Am I the only one loving these ideas? Sigh, so alone.</p>
<p><b>ChromeLite</b><br />The web is faster without Images, so why not remove them all? Oh, and style sheets.. who needs them! Thanks to <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/bjekedpipaedojkbialnhabcecmfpofh" target="_blank">ChromeLite</a> you can do just that. The entire Internet suddenly becomes text based! Try it for yourself over on the chrome extension gallery.</p>
