As the release day approaches (1st Nivember) retailers are cutting their prices over and over to compete for the cheapest price on release day. Currently amazon are offering this beauty for £600, which is £200 cheaper than it's original price a few weeks ago. I have to admit 25% off the price before it's even released is a huge bargin if you ask me. Considering what you get for the money this is amazing value, especially since the 16GB iPad is currently going for almost £500 on Amazon right now. Personally, you know I hate Apple products, so for an extra £100 you can get a very decent piece of hardware, and a great Operating System (Android 2.2) to back it. That said, is it worth waiting out for the HTC Tablet rumoured for early release next year? This will most likely be much better as it will be running Android 3.0 (Gingerbread).</p>
