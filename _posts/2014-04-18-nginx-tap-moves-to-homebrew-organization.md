The community tap I created for custom Nginx modules within Homebrew just got accepted into the official [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew) organization. This is huge news for the project as it means there should be way more usage and contributions thanks to the extra exposure. This is also a good time to share a couple of unannounced updates I added in the last couple of weeks.

Thanks to the new [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/Homebrew/homebrew-nginx) tests we can now detect and prevent errors before they are even merged. There's also a cool new site dedicated to listing all of the available [modules](http://brew.sh/homebrew-nginx/) and their current versions. None of these updates should impact you as a user, just continue using it and watch out for great new features and updates. Instructions for installing are over at [https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-nginx](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-nginx) where you can also fork the code and contribute modules.
