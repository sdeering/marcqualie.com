Over at EnGadget they have a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/samsung-galaxy-tab-in-the-wild-and-teasing-cdma/">Samsung Galaxy Tab Gallery</a> which they were sent from an unofficial source. In their post they say how ridiculous it's getting due to the fact this device keeps surfacing everywhere, without any official kind of response from Samsung. Obviously, this thing has been in the media so often it's quite hard to believe it's not a real device, however, no indication on when, or where it will be released to the public. Personally, I would love a device like this, due to the fact it is both Android and Samsung. </p>
<p>The tipsters reported that the Tab runs flash, Android 2.2 and has great speaker and call quality. I'm sure it beholds many other great features but we won't know until someone official in the Tech area can get their hands on one! Hopefully it will be coming to our stores soon, but until then we can only keep our fingers and toes crossed it won't be too long of a wait.</p>
