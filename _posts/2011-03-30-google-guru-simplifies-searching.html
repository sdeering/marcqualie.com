Google have just realised a useful new tool called Guru. Guru is a little chat bot that you can add to your Google Talk contacts. It's a simple way for you to get fast search results for simple queries, or do quick calculations and translations on the fly. As a heavy GTalk user I find this tool very useful, but even more so because of the fact I'm building my own similar bot! More on that later, though. I did a quick test and Guru is pretty swift at translating between languages, running calculations and even converting currency (my favourite feature). Simply add <b>guru@googlelabs.com</b> to your chat list and start typing queries to your new found friend. More information and query wiki available the <a href="http://guru.googlelabs.com/" target="_blank">Google Talk Guru</a> page.</p>
