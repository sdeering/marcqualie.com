I'm so excited for the launch of Mass Effect 3 that I felt like I had to write about it to get it out of my system. I was extremely disappointed when the launch got delayed, as it was planned to launch a few days after my Birthday last October. However, after hearing about the reasons behind it, I didn't care too much. Kinect Voice Integration is going to be so awesome, yet extremely nerdy at the same time. Shouting at your Xbox, giving virtual characters commands as you blast your way through space and stop the Galaxy from being destroyed? Hell yeah! The Demo is going to be launched on February 14th (Unlucky for our girlfriends, or boyfriends for you gamer girls!) and the game will be fully launched to all platforms on March 9th so if you haven't planned to play it yet then get the date set. I have no idea what the Multilayer will be like but I'm sure it's going to be insane and huge. Now I'm off to go and play through Mass Effect 2 again, since I've completed the first game twice already.. see you guys next month, maybe?</p>
