It's about time for a change. I recently made a huge change on <a href="http://marcqualie.com/">marcqualie.com</a>, not only on the front end presentation, but I also rewrote all of the server side scripting powering the entire site. It now loads faster, more efficient and looks much nicer. There are still way more changes to make, but things are moving along swiftly, bringing me to my current point; Redesigning my current Blog Layout.</p>
<p><a name='more'></a>For a while now I've been wanting to redo everything on my Blog but just haven't had the time. Now it falls into place with the marcqualie.com rewrite, so it makes sense. Changes will include moving from a dark theme to a light one, upgrading the screen resolution and creating powerful widgets to make it more interactive.</p>
<p>Upgrading to a bigger screen resolution was a tough choice, but in the end I decided to only support screens with 1280px width and above. About 8% of my readers are using a smaller screen so I will have to find a way to display the least important information on the right hand side, or ignore these users all together. Since you guys are the reason I Blog in the first place, then I have decided to create a layout which supports all screens, but adds upgrades for larger screens, similar to the way I code better for more modern browsers.</p>
<p>Next up is the colour scheme. As you may have guessed I'm not much of a designer any more, so making my website look attractive has always been an issue for me.I'm going to be working with a few friends who are experienced artists to try and create a beautiful website that not only looks amazing, but feels great to navigate and explore.</p>
<p>As time goes by I will be posting a lot more articles on programming and development. I have about 10 drafts that I will be publishing in the next couple of weeks with some very interesting content that I know you're all going to love! Ever wanted to create your very own PHP Gtalk Bot? I've got that covered! Worried about server security? I'll teach you all you need to know, and more!</p>
