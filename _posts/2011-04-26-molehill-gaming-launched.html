Hey guys! It's a while since I posted, but it's all for a good cause, I promise. Recently I joined forces with a friend and we become a single identity known as &#8220;The Mole&#8221;. &#8220;Why The Mole?&#8221;, I hear you you ask; well it's simple, we just launched <a href="http://www.molehillgaming.com/">Molehill Gaming</a>!</p>
<p><a name='more'></a><br />Molehill Gaming is a new Blog, Portal and Forum for all things related to the Adobe Molehill API. If you don't already know what this is then head over to the site and check out some of the amazing demos! We update the site daily with new content and our forums are a great place to get involved in the community if you're a flash developer or an amazed onlooker.</p>
