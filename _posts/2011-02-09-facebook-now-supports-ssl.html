I've been waiting for this for quite a while, so now that Facebook have officially released native SSL (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer">Secure Sockets Layer</a>) I'm a very happy man! Thanks to all the privacy concerns regarding Facebook (such as the ability to log in to any one's session on the network as you), I tend to avoid using the service very much, or at all. The fact someone could easily hijack my account simply by sniffing the wireless network has made me very security conscious lately; so much so that I have moved all of my servers to https:// for any form of action I wouldn't want people to even get a hint of. Such as my love for kittens, maybe? <br /><a name='more'></a>I also browse the Internet via as many https connection as I can, including Google, and any form of messaging system I use. I would encourage you to do the same! Anyways, I digress! You can enable the secure option in Facebook by going to &#8220;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/editaccount.php" target="_blank">Account Settings</a>&#8220;, then &#8220;Account Security&#8221;. There should be an option labelled &#8220;Browse Facebook on a secure connection (https) whenever possible&#8221;, just tick the box and click save. From now on Facebook will attempt to use https wherever possible. Oh, and for those of you who have tried forcing https before, only to find that chat doesn't work, you have no need to worry as they have taken this into consideration and chat works perfectly fine. On a side note, although your connection is now secured, Facebook will feel a lot slower to browse due to the nature of the https protocol.</p>
