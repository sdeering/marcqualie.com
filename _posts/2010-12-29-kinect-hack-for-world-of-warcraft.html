<p>As many of you may know, Xbox Kinect has been hacked many times for various different reasons on the PC. Now the millions of gamers can play their favourite Wow experiences using body gestures rather than a keyboard. This enhanced use of Kinect on one of the world's most popular online computer games demonstrates exactly how powerful the future of gaming is going to be. Maybe when the &#8220;official&#8221; PC drivers are released (as Microsoft have hinted at the possibility of this), more top gaming companies will embrace this new way of controlling games. I am buying my own Kinect in the morning and can't wait to start hacking away at different projects for myself and others.</p>
