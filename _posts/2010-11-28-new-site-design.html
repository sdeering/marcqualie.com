I modified the layout on <a href="http://marcqualie.com/">marcqualie.com</a> about an hour ago, just wondering what you guys think? Some of you may be thinking &#8220;well, it looks the same&#8221;, and yes, you would be right in thinking that. I've only made very subtle changes. Below are the current front end changes</p>
<ul>
<li>Background is dark, with a parchment overlay</li>
<li>Navigation is more compact and uses CSS3 for styling</li>
<li><a href="http://www.marcqualie.com/">Homepage</a> has featured section, with interactive scroller</li>
<li>User Accounts (ready for my secret projects)</li>
<li>More compact <a href="http://www.marcqualie.com/games/">games section</a>, faster loading, better looking</li>
<li>90% of images removed, all done via cross browser CSS, and clever tweaks</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<div>There are a few other changes too, but they are hidden, or not live yet. The change wasn't to make the site look better (even though i think it did), but to ultimately make the site better, and the backend structure is new. I am currently in the process of loading the site onto 4 new cloud servers around the world for faster loading in each area of the world. I am also uploading about 5 new advanced web apps for you guys to use and enjoy. You will, of course, need a marcqualie.com user account to access these new apps, but fortunately you can get one of these buy connecting to your Google Profile, it's that simple. Keep checking back for updates, and subscribe to my <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/marcqualie">Blog</a>!</div>
