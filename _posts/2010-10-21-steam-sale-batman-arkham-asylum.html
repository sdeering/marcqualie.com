Just thought I'd inform everyone that <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/" target="_blank">Steam</a> has a weekend sale on <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/35140" target="_blank">Batman Arkham Asylum</a>. I only feel like sharing this as I've been wanting this game for a while, but didn't feel like paying £30 (as I'm cheap!). Head over to Steam to download the game for £10.20, which is 66% off. Also, anyone who has Steam, add me and play games with me! Borderlands and Dead Rising 2 are my favourites at the moment.</p>
