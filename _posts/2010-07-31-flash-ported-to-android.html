I just stumbled upon an entry in <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/air2/android/" target="_blank">Adobe Labs</a> which demonstrates how to convert Actionscript 3.0 to Android APK files. Essentially this means you can code an application in pure actionscript, then convert that app into Android format which will run the same on the Mobile, as it does on the Desktop. I don't know about you but I am extremely excited about this.</p>
<p>Not only am I currently working on improving my Actionscript (See separate blog posts on this), but I was also planning on creating an Android Developer account once I purchase my new phone, which I am hoping will run Android 2.1, or even better Android 2.2.</p>
<p>Currently I still have the G1, so unfortunately I can't do much with this device as it is nearly 2 years old, and still running Android 1.6. Features and performance wise, it still outdoes the iPhone hands downÂ (sly dig much?). However from a Development point of view I would rather start developing for higher end models with extra features such as multi touch.</p>
<p>Another amazing advantage is that in an early post I was planning on porting <a href="http://blog.marcqualie.com/2010/07/adobe-air-revisited.html">Squiggle Canvas to desktop using Adobe Air</a>. Now I can code this desktop application, and use the same code and IDE to port the app straight to Android! Not only would you now have Squiggle Canvas on your phone, but you can also sync your drawings with your android device! Awesome, right?</p>
<p>On a final note, I failed to mention earlier that this is a port of Adobe AIR to Android, not specifically Actionscript. So this will hopefully include plain HTML & Javascript applications too, however I will have to play around with this in the future when I find some coding playtime.</p>
