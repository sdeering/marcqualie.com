Well, it's Sunday night and I can happily say I have achieved a lot over the course of the weekend, both work related and personal. First of all, I finished a huge project I've been working on at work, and I'm hoping that's the end of it. Don't you just love having that warm feeling inside where you know you can happily move on to something new and exciting? Me too.</p>
<p>Secondly I am developing a small game for Halloween, I originally was going to make this a multi player racing/chaos zombie game, but it ended up taking too much time to develop as I have barely any free time! Not to worry though, I've decided to still work on the game, but release it for Christmas instead! So now the game is totally different, and I developed it in one night. I will be adding tweaks over the next day or two if any bugs arise and to add things like menus, scoreboard, and graphics done by a friend.</p>
<p>Finally, I decided to upgrade my computer (<a href="http://blog.marcqualie.com/2010/10/steam-sale-batman-arkham-asylum.html">Batman</a> lagged!), and bring an old laptop back to life. To fix the lag issue I upgraded with an extra 4GB of RAM, disabled my page-file, and optimized my system settings etc, and now it runs perfectly on very high graphics settings, score! My old laptop wasn't as easy to resurrect, though. First of all, It's charger was destroyed, so I had to replace that.. expensive. Then the OS was running extremely slow as it's about 4 years old and full of all my old junk, I fixed this by backing up my data then installing Ubuntu. Sorted. Now for the real killer, the keyboard is dysfunctional (by this I mean broken, not misbehaving). Now I need to find a replacement keyboard to use my new shiny Ubunutu Development system. Good luck tracking parts down for an almost 4 year old laptop. But never mind, I will get there, in time.</p>
<p>So that's the story of Marc's weekend. I spent some time with my Sexy Girlfriend, went to Nando's then Cinema (Easy A is an epic Movie by the way) and slept a lot also, but this isn't at all productive so let's pretend I was constantly working, yeah? Now I intend to Play Batman, Eat pizza and Drink until I pass out in the early hours of the morning. I don't think I could get more geeky if I tried!</p>
