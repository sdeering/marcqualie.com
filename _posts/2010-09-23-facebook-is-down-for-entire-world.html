Well, it appear Facebook is down for everyone, not just here in the UK. Noy only that, but like buttons around the internet have collapsed aswel due to the outage. Reports from Tech sites indicate this is a DNS error, which is affecting the entire world. Imagine how many like buttons are on websites around the world, this is going to have a huge impact on a lot of sites. I'm so glad I don't use Facebook for any of my sites anymore, exactly for this reason! Let's hope it's back up soon, as I'm still deleting people from <a href="http://blog.marcqualie.com/2010/09/operation-social-cleanup-facebook.html">Operation SocialÂ Clean-up</a>.</p>
