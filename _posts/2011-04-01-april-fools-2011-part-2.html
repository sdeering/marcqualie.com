This is second part to my earlier post, which I dedicated to being called the <a href="http://blog.marcqualie.com/2011/04/april-fools-day-2011-google-edition.html">April Fools Google Edition</a> due to the fact Google had so many didn't departments pulling their own pranks. This post is a more broad look on some of the other big companies who took part in amusing the world on sacred April Fools Day.</p>
<p><a name='more'></a><b>Mootols Core Localisation</b><br />This one actually tricked me, and I ended up making an idiot of myself on Twitter in the process. That's what no caffeine for two days will do to you! Mootools have decided it's a good idea to let programmers write <a href="http://mootools.net/blog/2011/04/01/mootools-gets-a-little-closer-to-home/" target="_blank">Mootools in their Native language</a> so it's easier to read and use without needing to know English. I thought this was an outrage, and promptly posted my resignation of Mootools, which them made me realise I'm an Idiot. Well played, Mootools. Well Played.</p>
<p><b>Meebo Carrier Pigeons</b><br />Since everyone is so focused on the future these days, Meebo took a strep in the other direction. Why not use an ancient messaging system to send messages to friends? Introducing Meebo Carrier Pigeons! Full details over at the <a href="http://blog.meebo.com/?p=3200" target="_blank">Meebo Blog</a>.</p>
<p><b>Hootsuite Happy Owls</b><br />Well, I was meant to keep this secret according to the private and confidential email I received earlier, but it's just too good to not share. Apparently, they're bored of social integration now and want to try something new and cool, like say, gaming? Enter <a href="http://hootsuite.com/happy-owls" target="_blank">Happy owls</a>! Looks really familiar, no Idea why though..</p>
<p>There are many others but I've just selected my favourites. If you want a huge list of all the pranks that happened today then head over to Tech Crunch, as they have a huge list of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/01/april-fools-2011-the-big-list/" target="_blank">April Fools Pranks 2011</a>.</p>
