Some of you may already know about the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/get/" target="_blank">Steam Give and Get Sale</a>, for those of you that don't now is a good time to find out. For the next five days Steam will have a selection of featured games at reduced prices for 24 hours. Some of these games will also be available as pack downloads, which means you can get even cheaper prices if you buy with a group of friends! That's sound great, right? Well, here comes the added bonus. Every day, 30 people will be given the top 5 games on their wish lists for free. Yes, free! All you have to do is buy games in the sale, and be in for a chance to win. So why are you still here? Go and build a wish list!</p>
