If you've been on the internet over the last few days you will have noticed the CES (Consumer Electronics Show) took place. Unfortunately I wasn't able to get on-line to post coverage of the event, but I will be posting over the course of today with highlights and my favourites from companies such as Sony, Samsung and Google. There are a lot of amazing products both being released, and on the cards for release later this year. I´ll try my best to find all the best ones and post them here today.</p>
