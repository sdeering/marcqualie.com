I'm posting this via the new Blogger for Android application, which sounds far looks very nice. Seems to be lacking editing features though, as I can only edit my mobile posts, which don't exist yet. Myself, and many other Bloggers have been waiting a long time to native support, but as usual Google have released it with limited features and will hopefully post updates. Next up I'm hoping for native android and picasa support, what's keeping you,Â  Google? </p>
