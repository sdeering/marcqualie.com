Just my luck! Seems like karma is totally against me this week. Maybe it's a sign I should stop being so lazy an start doing more work? Or maybe it's a sign to give up trying because it will amount to nothing in the end? I'm going to be optimistic and go for the first option!</p>
<p>Back on track about my story. A few months ago I registered for Dropbox, a great service for managing files across all the computers I use at home and at work. It's one of the best sharing softwares I've found if I'm honest, use it almost everyday now and will most certainly be buying it's upgrade package once I run out of storage.</p>
<p>Last night they launched a new Beta service for Android, which I've been waiting on for months! I even registered my email to be notified when the release was available. But instead they decide to post on their Twitter account that the first 500 people to go to their forums get the new Beta product. Guess what I was doing last night when this was happening? I was cooking a nice meal for my Girlfriend so I completely missed out on this opportunity, which if you've read my previous posts, you will guess I'm rather annoyed about due to the fact I love my Android phone!</p>
<p>So I now have to sit and wait patiently until the stable release is available for all public users. Great! Still looking forward to it though, I guess it will teach me to always be online in case someone posts something interesting for once! I just can't believe the one time I didn't check my feeds they post it.</p>
<p>But for now you can all help me out, and yourselves, by getting a Dropbox account. Use my sign up link below and we both receive extra space!</p>
