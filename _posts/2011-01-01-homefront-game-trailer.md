Homefront looks to be a pretty amazing game if I'm honest. I'm partially biased due to the fact I'm very addicted to Battlefield, which is a very similar genre. Homefront is trying to put the realism into the war based gaming genre, which is one of the main reason I prefer Battlefield over Call of Duty. It's being released on the 11th March 2011, and I know I will definitely be buying it.
