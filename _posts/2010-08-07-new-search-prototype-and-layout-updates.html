<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">It's officially the weekend, so I've decided it's time for me to finish off a few loose end projects I've been messing about with the last few weeks. Unfortunately I don't get much time to work outside of my main job these days, so it's worth the extra effort when I get a product finished. Today's changes include updated layout, more sharing options, optimized code, more games and a brand new Search Engine.</span></span>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 13px;"><br /></span></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">First of all you may have noticed the new icons along the top of the page? Basically those have been put there just to give you a better way of following me if you don't read my Blog RSS Feed. You're bound to have one of the accounts listed above, so go ahead and subscribe to me already! Secondly I have added more games to the games section. These games are provided Free Online Games, and I will be adding more as soon as I can. Hopefully this section will have a quite a few thousand games when my new system is built, however that's a whole new story for a later date.</span></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 13px;"><br /></span></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">Now for the main feature, my brand new Search Engine. Not only does this index the content on Marc Qualie, and my Blog, but it can index the entire web. I basically coded a bot to crawl pages and index them acording to a system such as link algorithms, meta data, and open graph information. This is then compressed, stored, then indexed by a second robot to get instant results for any combination of key words. You can test out it's usefulness <a href="http://www.marcqualie.com/search/?q=adobe+air+android">here</a>. As you can see Adobe AIR posts come first, then the Adobe label, then an <b><i>air</i></b> based game, followed by an android tag. I never said it was perfect, but this is still an early prototype, and very relavent results are displayed in microseconds (that's fast!).</span></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 13px;"><br /></span></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">You may also notice the game results, and the homepage have thumbnails to show more interactive content. This is another algorithm I have been working on, taking data from open graph info, and media content within Blog etc. This is then checked against incoming link titles, and alt tags on images, to display the most relevant thumbnail. Clever stuff, but I still have so much more planned. If you have any suggestions please let me know as I am hoping to release this engine on a large scale when I get better web hosting. Who knows, I might make the next Google? <img src='http://blog.marcqualie.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </span></span></div>
