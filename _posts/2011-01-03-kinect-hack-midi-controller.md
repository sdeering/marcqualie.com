Not really much to say about this one apart from how clearly awesome this thing could be. I'd loved to be able to compose music without ever playing a note on a keyboard or twanging my guitar. It also brings memories of when I used to use FLStudio (Fruityloops back then) quite a lot to make insane dance music. Keep the hacks coming, and also an adapter so I can start making my own! My about that in my next post.
