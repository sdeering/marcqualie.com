<p>Where has the time gone! I've been working at my new job for almost a whole month now and it still feels like I've just started! For those of you that don't know I'm now a programmer at <a href="http://www.performancehorizon.com/" title="Performance Horizon" target="_blank">Performance Horizon</a> which is pretty awesome; quite the change from flash gaming! It's also the main reason I've been neglecting my personal projects and blog updates to concentrate all the cool things I've been working on.</p>

<p>My backlog of projects to upload to Github is quite big so this week I'm going to be uploading them, starting with the full source code to my <a href="http://blog.marcqualie.com/2012/04/javascript-racing-game-prototype.html" title="Javascript Racing Game Prototype" target="_blank">Javascript Racing Engine</a> which I plan to do more work on in the future and maybe make it into a mini mobile game. I also have a great Javascript gaming engine which I built, unrelated to the racing engine which has all the standard features from the Actionscript 3.0 library such as asset embedding, rotation, sprite animation, audio and more!</p>

<p>Secondly, I've done so much work on my <a href="https://github.com/marcqualie/hoard" title="Hoard" target="_blank">Hoard</a> project which I'm still putting together as it's integrated deeply inside one of my other projects. It has great new features including more control over user permissions, custom data types, import/export and a dashboard reporting system with an example of how to build a simple web analytics engine ontop of the core code. I'm also working on making it run out of the box with Nginx servers, but I'm still new to tweaking those for performance and stability.</p>

<p>I've also got a few server modules I've been building for custom configs and I've found some pretty cool new tech to share with you guys once I've drafted together some tutorials and tips on how to install and use them. As usual, I build all of my sites ontop of the <a href="http://manage.aff.biz/z/146/CD18136/" title="VPS Cloud Hosting" target="_blank">VPS.net</a> network, but I've recently found a great new tool called Vagrant which is making server development so much easier (and cheaper) then deploying custom servers. Obviously there is the disadvantage of slow networking and no public access unless you configure your router which will hog your home connection.</p>
<p>Lastly, I've just updated my blog to use Bootstrap 2.1.0 which I think gives it a much cleaner and brighter feel than before. If you haven't tried it out, I recommend using it as it speeds up development so much if you're a developer and just want to throw together a quick prototype before you get a designer to polish it up. Feel free to comment if you have any requests for which projects I should open source first, or have any suggestions for new posts.</p>
