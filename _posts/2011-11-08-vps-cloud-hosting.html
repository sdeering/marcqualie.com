If you've been following my recent posts you'll notice I've got quite an addiction to using <a href="http://blog.marcqualie.com/2011/11/introduction-to-nodejs-building-web.html">Node.js</a>. I'm taking a break from that right now to talk about the tech behind powering the apps I'm building, which wouldn't be possible without reliable and powerful hosting. Recently I came across an awesome hosting provider <a href="http://vps.net/" target="_blank">vps.net</a>. Up until a few weeks ago I was a loyal Amazon Web Services user, all of my sites and projects were hosted on their powerful cloud platform except bandwidth was a huge problem in terms of cost, so I had to look elsewhere. Enter VPS! <br /><br/><a name='more'></a>Originally I used only used VPS to distribute bandwidth to external servers around the world, as a simple CDN system. I installed a custom built shell script onto the new servers (which I will happily share in a separate post later tonight) that would take commands from the master and sync up all of my static content. My major reasons behind using VPS were the fact a colleague had previously used them, and the fact they had hosting in London, which was great since I'm from the UK. This was also one of the reasons I was drawn to AWS and their EC2 system which provided hosting in Ireland, which still wasn't as close as I'd have liked.  <br/><br/>After using the servers for a little while I started to experiment with them a bit more (mainly due the fact they had a node sale!) and started hosting some sites on there and found them to be more reliable, easier to manage and cheaper than AWS. The main features that persuaded me to move over was the large amount of bandwidth offered, and most importantly, root access with a huge choice of Linux Installs. Not many providers are offering root access at low prices, unless you splash out for an expensive heavy duty dedicated server. This is why I love virtual cloud hosting, cheap, powerful and scalable.  <br/><br/>What is even more amazing is it's very easy to scale your nodes up and down while their still in use. This was great when one of my sites started to receive more traffic. Rather than buying a new, more powerful server, then switching the content and getting rid of the old server (which is the case with most hosting providers); I would simply increase the amount of CPU and Hard Drive Capacity and only pay for the extra usage  when it was needed, without any downtime or hassle. This is a major win, considering I have to manage  a lot of growing sites and don't want to pay out a lot at the start, or have the hassle once they grow.  <br/><br/>I would recommend VPS to anyone wanting to get into the cloud hosting side of things, or even just want to host something as simple as a game server or as a backup system due to the customisability and cost savings. There a many, many more features available than I've described above, so why not go check them out for yourself?</p>
