Recently I've been looking into a lot of Technology and Software to improve the performance and scalability of some of the projects I've been working on. This has been proving difficult as we implement more and more features, adding extra strain to databases, web servers and budget. One of the major problems we kept seeing was overloaded CPUs, bottlenecked Databases and huge ammounts of bandwidth being consumed, so a new plan was needed. Over the next few weeks I'll be posting articles on how to save money, improve performance and even improve security of your sites and applications using <a href="https://www.varnish-cache.org/" target="_blank" title="Varnish Cache">Varnish Cache</a>. One of the main reasons I am so inclined to use it is the fact Facebook have chosen to adopt it to power some of their features, so it obviously scales rather impressively. Case studies will include things like Multiple Backends, Traffic Routing, Proxying, Load Balancing, Static Caching and maybe even building a personal CDN service for readers working with clusters and large amounts of static content. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about Varnish or other server performance enhancing techniques. I've already started using it on a few sites, and I can see performance improvements already with minimal configuration.</p>
