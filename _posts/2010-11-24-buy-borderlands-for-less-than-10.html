One my favorite games, <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/8980/" target="_blank">Borderlands</a> is now in the 5 day sale on Steam. You can grab the game for £9.99 for 24 hours only. I would really recommend this game, which brings first person shooting into the world of role playing games. With a Left 4 Dead style 4 player co-op, you can play online with your friends too. If you buy the game, add my to steam (<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/marcoqualie/" target="_blank">MarcQualie</a>) and invite me into a game! Check out the game link above for full details and gameplay shots.</p>
