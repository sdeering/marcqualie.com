<p>I just came accross this awesome website for finding Android Devices. I had an idea to do this sort of project myself, however just never found the time, nor the resources to get it done. If you're looking for an Android phone, which I really hope you are, then this is the perfect place for you. I have embdedded the video on the left for you to get a quick overview, but I think it's a bit boring, and takes way too long to get to the point. You can go straight to <a href="http://www.droidthing.com/" target="_blank">DroidThing.com</a> to check it out for yourself. So much to choose from, which one will you go for?</p>
