<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 13px;"><b>*Update* </b>Since posting this article I've moved Squiggle to a new location on <a href="http://squigglecanvas.com/">squigglecanvas.com</a>, I rewrote the entire application, and it's now integrated with Facebook. Try it out?</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 13px;"><br /></span></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">So I've been a little busy adding new features to the <a href="http://www.squigglecanvas.com/">Squiggle Canvas</a> project. I added 4 new brush types for you guys to try out. Just go visit the page and see what nice things you can Draw.</span></span>

<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">I have been browsing the internet for similar projects that utilize the canvas as a drawing tool. I found an amazing application called harmony. It wasn't bursting with features, it was actually the most simple out of all the ones I could find, however the brush techniques used were amazing. I used my favourites as a base for designing the new Brush techniques you will see on my project.</span></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 13px;"><br /></span></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">I got them almost exact, but there are a few differences, as our projects are coded differently, I will hopefully improve this as the project progresses nearer a finished product. The project plan looks amazing, and will be released as a Standalone website, aswel as a widget plugin that can be placed anywhere with one line of code. Pretty sweet huh? Below is description of the new brush types and what you can use them for.</span></span></div>
<p>
<div style="margin-left: 15px;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 13px;"><b>Fur</b> &#8211; Fur-like brush which uses fibres that group together to create a really nice natural look to your project. The fibres act like a magnet when you move them next to other lines of the same brush type, giving a more fluent feel to drawing.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><b>Long Fur</b> &#8211; Same as fur, but with longer fibres, given a nicer effect on small line widths. They group together more aswel, so you can create really nice flowing images with this technique.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><b>Grid</b> &#8211; This effect looks pretty nice if you can get it right, but I think i need to optimize it more, let me know what you think of this one? It basically defines grid points where the lines will expand from, using a quadratic curve around the point to give a paint-brush effect but only every 50px on the canvas.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><b>Chrome</b> &#8211; My personal favourite. Use this brush to create very nice fluent and attractive images, try grouping the lines together and you you will see it creates a transparent connection effect between, which gives the feeling of depth when you move the mouse fast, and build up layers on top of each other.</span></div>
<p>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">On a side note away from the brush types, I added quite a log of new features. Main feature being the ability to create a new Squiggle and save it to the gallery and share it once you're done, with the option to undo and redo changes with any brush type.</span></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 13px;"><br /></span></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">Keep checking back as I'm trying to add new features every day, any suggestions you have would be very helpful.</span></span></div>
