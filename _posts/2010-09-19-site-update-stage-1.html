Just a quick note to say I've updated my site a little bit, just wanting some feedback? Going to add more features tomorrow such as more <a href="http://www.marcqualie.com/projects/">projects</a>, more <a href="http://www.marcqualie.com/games/">games</a>Â and more <a href="http://blog.marcqualie.com/">Blog Posts</a>. As you may have noticed, the artistic skills my homepage are pretty dismal, however, I am hoping to fix this when I can use the Graphics tablet at work tomorrow, so fingers crossed! One of the projects I will be adding is a Drawing portfolio, so you can see my progress as I slowly learn how to draw! I also need ideas on what to write about in my blog posts as I would like to post everyday. All suggestions are welcome, thanks!</p>
