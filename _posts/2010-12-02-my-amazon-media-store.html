Some of you may have noticed the <a href="http://www.marcqualie.com/store/">Store</a> which is now available on my website. If you haven't, then I suggest you head over to <a href="http://marcqualie.com/">marcqualie.com</a> and check it out. I now have an Amazon affiliate program where I can promote Amazon's products via my site. I sell any item, mainly featuring DVDs and Games (Including Consoles). This store is entirely secure, and everything is purchased via the Main Amazon website. The only difference is I receive around 5% of the purchase price per item. So get shopping! Also, if you're feeling extra generous you can buy me a gift from my own store!</p>
