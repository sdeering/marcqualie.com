This just made my day! Someone just forwarded me a link to a broke iPhone, which is supposidly unbreakable. Apple themselves say it's &#8220;chemically strengthened to be 20 times stiffer and 30 times harder than plastic&#8221;. Yeah, right. If it can't even survive being dropped on the floor, what chance does it have in the hands of today's teen fanbase? Bye bye iPhones.</p>
