Today, a colleague just sent me an invite to a service called codesnip,it (even though I introduced him to it in the first place?) and I'm finding the service to be quite a good idea. Many of the social networks for developers are just developers asking questions to other developers, which for the majority of time, these questions are quite ridiculous. The selling point of this service is the fact it's all about posting small snippits of code, which on their own don't do much, however can be used as part of other projects, as part of the much bigger picture. This makes so much more sense than having entire projects, which you may only want to use one part of, or you need one bit of functionality. Unfortunately, I have failed to find anything useful on the site, but then again, it's on a Beta, Invite only stage right now, but it has promise. In time I'm hoping experiences developers will contribute great code to the site. So far, my impression of the site is &#8220;Twitter of Code&#8221; due it's simplistic functionality, but also great way of sharing small amounts of info fast to a large number of people using their follow system. If you're a developer and would like an invite, let me know and I'll send you one.</p>
