I've just added a Share Bar to my site. Simply go to <a href="http://www.marcqualie.com/">www.marcqualie.com</a> and look at the bottom of the screen to share content. Currently, the bar will not show on <a href="http://blog.marcqualie.com/">blog.marcqualie.com</a>, but I will build an API system that allows me to do this later tonight. So for now, just have a browse around and like some things?</p>
