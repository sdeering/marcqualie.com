Facebook have finally started rolling out their new messaging system to all users! I wrote about this along with the <a href="http://blog.marcqualie.com/2010/12/mark-zuckerberg-to-unveil-new-profile.html">new profiles</a> a few months ago, back in November, and back then I was excited to use the service. I've included a screen shot I took a few minutes ago, it shows the page for opting into the new system early via an invite as you can see. Hopefully I'll get this soon, and can start giving you guys feedback and my opinions. The feature I'm looking forward to the most is the @facebook.com email addresses, and integration with current email programs such as Gmail!</p>
