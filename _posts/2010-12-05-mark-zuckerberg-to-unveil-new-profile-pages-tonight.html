New Facebook? Yes please. In my opinion, as many of you know, Facebook isn't much use. Yes, you can talk to your friends, share content and upload photos. But in this modern age, what website doesn't allow you to do that? That said, Facebook is clearly not slowing down in rates of numbers, or content. For quite a while now, I've been hoping they will update their site to be a bit more useful, and less locked down. I believe Facebook has too much control over users now, as all of their content is exclusive to their site, and can't be shared, even though that's the whole idea behind Facebook. In light of the new messaging system, this should hopefully start to change. I love the idea of being able to use my current ways of communication such as Gmail to connect with my Facebook friends. Back on topic, Mark Zuckerberg with be showing us the brand new Facebook Profiles this evening, which should make Facebook much more use friendly and easy to use. The video will be embedded here for you guys to watch at around 18:30 EST (23:30 GMT) ready for the 7pm start time.</p>
