Did you know you can also create symlinks using PHP? Now when you have a lot of files you want to symlink in bulk, such as Apache project files which I described in a previous Blog post, you can simply create a php file to do all the work for you. I plan to build a backup script, which will copy all my project files and certain programs from my OS drive, to my external drive so I can use them in multiple locations easily, and also make it easier to backup if I wish to do a System Restore or something. You can find all the information on the <a href="http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.symlink.php">php website</a> for how to use the function. It is very similar to the <a href="http://blog.marcqualie.com/2010/09/symbolic-links-in-windows-7.html">command line code</a> I put in a previous post.</p>
