After months of putting it off I've finaly decided to buy the poster I wanted from <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/" target="_blank">The Oatmeal</a>! The poster I bought was, of course, <a href="http://goo.gl/hcEgh">How A Web Design Goes Straight To Hell</a>. Why did I decided to finally buy this poster? They offered me something free! Why would I turn down something free? That's just silly. From today they now offer a free Facts About Coffee poster with every purchase of a poster or print. Pretty neat. So I basically got two posters for the price of one. Go check out their shop over at <a href="http://shop.theoatmeal.com/" target="_blank">http://shop.theoatmeal.com/</a></p>
