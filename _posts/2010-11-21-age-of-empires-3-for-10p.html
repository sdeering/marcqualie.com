A friend of mine told me about Age of Empires 3 on sale for 10p over at Microsoft. Naturally I laughed in his face and told him to stop smoking shit, but turns out it's entirely legit! Apparently part of some 7 day daily deal they were holding as part of a new Games For Windows website launch. I hate the fact I found out on the last day, as they were selling off some real good games for dirt cheap. Luckily, you can still grab AOE3 for 10p until 10am PST. Follow the link below if you're interested</p>
