Heard of Balloonacy? Most of you will have, whether you have an Orange mobile or not you will have come across this game at some point. Basically, you race virtual balloons across the Internet with your friends, competing for the best times and prizes from Orange. Each part of the race course is a different website, normally a blog or portfolio for small developers, such as myself. If you want to join the race head over to <a href="http://www.marcqualie.com/balloonacy/">http://www.marcqualie.com/balloonacy/</a> and grab a ballooon. Make sure to wave at me using the widget on the right.Race ends November 17th.</p>
