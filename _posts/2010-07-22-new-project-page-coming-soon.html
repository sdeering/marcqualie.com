As you can see I have started to build a new project section. Right now it's still very bare as all my projects are buried somewhere on my old hard-drive. I have decided to make a thumbnail system, with description previews, animation, and better search results for projects. This should make browsing the gallery much easier. If you preview the projects page right now, you will see blank image holders and the project name. Try out the projects if you want, some of them are quite cool.</p>
<p>As I find/create more projects, they will be gradually added to the list. If you have any requests/suggestions as to what projects I should make please contact me using the <a href="http://www.marcqualie.com/about/">About</a> page. I can make almost anything, as I love a challenge, but please be practical as my schedule is rather busy!</p>
