I only just realised the time, and also realised I've spent most of my time awake writing thousands and thousands of lines of code. The worst part is, I'm nowhere near my target of what I was meant to do this weekend! On the bright side, I've learned about 5 new APIs, improved performance, design and quality of my site by more than I had imagined and now have a database of over 7,000 games to start playing with when I wake up! You can check out all my new stuff below, more coming soon.</p>
