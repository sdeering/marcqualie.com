This post is mainly just to test and make sure my new site is running smoothly. I completely rewrote the framework so this post should be indexed in my database within minutes. Secondly I just noticed that google has started showing Profile results in search, which is quite cool! I don't know if anyone else has noticed, but Google are slowly creeping in Social place holders all over the place..<br /><a name='more'></a>It started with the new profile bar above most Google Products (which is very temperamental for me!), then Google Profiles being forced public, followed by Picasa Web's integration into profiles, and now People in Search results! I think something big is planned at Google IO in 6 weeks. Something amazing; oh how I wish I was able to attend!</p>
<p>Back to work related stuff, as I haven't posted here in a while! Firstly I have a new site (<a href="http://marcqualie.com/">marcqualie.com</a>), and everything loads stupidly fast! Even Google Page Speed could only pick faults with the Analytics code I was loading (how ironic..). Unfortunately I host my Blog on Blogger (might change to Word Press depending on how good the new Blogger Revamp is, and how long I have to wait), so I haven't had chance to update the site there yet. It normally syncs with the styles and scripts on my main site, but I made a quick exception for tonight, and will update tomorrow!</p>
<p>New projects coming this week including <b>Advanced Spelling Correction for PHP Search</b>, <b>CSS Compressor API</b>, <b>Visual Instant Search for Games</b> and I will finally be releasing my personal notes system to the public to use! Just because I haven't been posting doesn't mean I haven't been busy coding! I promise to post most and hope you guys enjoy the projects coming up!</p>
