Tumblr has been down for over 12 hours. That's half a day. Many people I know rely on Tumblr to run their blogs, and are going mental over the fact they've been down for so long. For a site with so many users this sort of downtime is very unacceptable. This is one of my main worries of relying on third party services for my content, if they fail, I fail.</p>
