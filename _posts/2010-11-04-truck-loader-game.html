This is a quick post to let everyone know about a new game I uploaded. The game is a prototype as part of the new FogDev program which I have been contributing to. The game is where you basically load boxes onto a truck, using a magnetised hook. Click the image on the left to play <a href="http://www.marcqualie.com/game/truck-loader/">Truck Loader</a>. There will be more information on the FogDev program when it is fully released to everyone.</p>
