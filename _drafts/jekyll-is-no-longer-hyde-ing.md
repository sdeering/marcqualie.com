After convincing myself all year that I will finally "Go Static" and get rid of my custom CMS for this Blog, I decided to finally launch it on the very last day of the year; Talk about leaving things until the last minute! This isn't a complete coincidence though, as I've been working hard on a new project which I will be writing about very shortly into the new year. I'm hopefully going to cover why I chose Jekyll, and why it's going to be so powerful moving into 2014.

## Why Jekyll over custom CMS?

This is the question on almost everyone's mind when I talk to them about Jekyll. A custom CMS can do almost anything you need it do. There are hundreds of them actively developed by the open source community which brings great software to the market. This is a great thing, however the whole work-flow gets on my nerves for many reasons.

### Almost too easy to set up

For those of you who have set-up a CMS (e.g Wordpress) you know it can be difficult to both initially set up and to maintain for a client. Setting up a performant and secure database. Installing a cache to keep things snappy. What about plug-ins? Wordpress version bumps and new plug-in versions? New themes? Your new theme doesn't work with one of the plug-ins that are running but an alternative plug-in doesn't work with another plug-in that is installed? Security patches? These are just a few of the many issues that developers run into when creating and maintaining a traditional CMS. Imagine if all of that was gone. Since Jekyll is entirely flat file based there is no database or cache needed to get performance. There is no dynamic scripting language so it's virtually impossible to get hacked. Updating the software is very easy in comparison and since it's all flat files you can simply role back (you are using version control, right?) to the previous version in seconds until you have more time to do an upgrade.

### No backup strategy needed
